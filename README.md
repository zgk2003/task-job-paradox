# Task-Job Paradox Research

An academic research proposal investigating why AI productivity tools demonstrate significant gains at the individual task level but fail to produce proportional improvements at the job/project completion level.

## Research Question

Why do AI tools show 15-50% productivity improvements at the task level, yet these gains don't translate into proportional improvements in overall job throughput?

## Key Focus Areas

- **Task-level metrics**: Code review latency, CI fix times, individual coding tasks
- **Job-level metrics**: PR lead time, release timing, overall project throughput
- **AI tools examined**: GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT

## Methodology

- Uses GitHub open-source development data from GH Archive (2021-2025)
- Interrupted time series analysis
- Difference-in-differences approach comparing programming languages with varying AI tool support
